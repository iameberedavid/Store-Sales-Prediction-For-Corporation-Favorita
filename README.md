## Project Description üìã

The primary focus of this project is to utilize time series regression analysis to forecast sales for Corporation Favorita, a prominent grocery retailer based in Ecuador.

The objective is to develop a robust model capable of accurately forecasting future sales by leveraging the extensive time series data of thousands of products sold across various Corporation Favorita locations. The resulting forecasts will provide valuable insights to the store's management, enabling them to formulate effective inventory and sales plans.

I will utilize the CRISP-DM framework to execute the project.


## Project Overview üñº

The project includes the following stages:

### 1. üì• Data Collection

- Azubi Africa's SQL Server database, GitHub repository and OneDrive.

N/B: The datasets from the sources above where saved in the root folder of this repository for easy access

### 2. üìö Data Loading

- Utilizing `pyodbc` for SQL data
- Leveraging `pandas` for CSV and Excel files

### 3. üí° Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Merging
- Duplicate checks
- Handling missing values
- Renaming Columns and Changing Datatypes
- Creating new features
- Visualizations
- Hypothesis testing
- ADF Testing

### 4. üìà Answering Questions with Visualizations

**Questions:**

- Is the train dataset complete (has all the required dates)?
- Which dates have the lowest and highest sales for each year?
- Did the earthquake impact sales?
- Are certain groups of stores making more sales than others? (Cluster, city, state, type)
- Are sales affected by promotions, oil prices and holidays?
- What analysis can we get from the date and its extractable features?
- What is the difference between RMSLE, RMSE, MSE (or why is the MAE greater than all of them?)
- What is the total sales made each year by the corporation?

**Visualization Tools:**

- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### 5. ‚öôÔ∏è Feature Engineering

- Data Splitting
- Feature Encoding with OneHotEncoder
- Feature Scaling with MinMaxScaler

### 6. ‚åõ Model Training

- Linear Regression
- XGBoost
- CatBoost
- AutoReg
- ARIMA
- SARIMA

### 7. üìä Model Evaluation

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (MSLE)
- Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE)

### 8. üéØ Hyperparameter Tuning

- RandomSearchCV

### 9. üí≠ Exportation

- os
- pickle
- save_model

## App Deployment üì≤

The model was embedded into a streamlit app and deployed for public usage. This was done in this GitHub repository: [Embed-Corporation-Favorita-Timeseries-Model-To-Streamlit](https://github.com/iameberedavid/Embed-Corporation-Favorita-Timeseries-Model-To-Streamlit). The deployment process was discussed in this medium article: [BUILDING A USER-FRIENDLY SALES PREDICTION APP USING STREAMLIT AND HUGGINGFACE](https://eberedavid.medium.com/embedding-timeseries-forecasting-analysis-for-corporation-favorita-model-to-streamlit-eefe13bf8bf2).
